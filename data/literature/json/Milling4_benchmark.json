  "additional_notes": "This keynote paper provides a comprehensive review of measures to improve the energy efficiency of metal cutting machine tools. A key finding is that the energy required for the actual chip removal process is far exceeded by the demands of auxiliary support units. Therefore, the most significant efficiency gains are found in optimizing these support systems through demand-oriented operation, rightsizing components, and adopting more efficient technologies. The paper concludes that while many technologies for energy savings are feasible, their implementation in industry is hindered by economic factors and a lack of integrated software tools."
