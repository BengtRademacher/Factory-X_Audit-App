  "additional_notes": "This thesis presents a framework to model energy consumption and assess the environmental impact of dry milling processes using a simplified experimental approach based on mechanistic modeling principles. A key finding is that for dry milling with solid tools, the environmental impact is dominated by the tool's lifecycle emissions, not the electricity consumed during the process. The proposed prediction model demonstrated good accuracy, though it tends to underestimate cutting power due to factors like unmodeled efficiency losses and tool wear."
